    <p class="col-full">These are the original design ideas for a coffee shop called The Darkest Roast.  To the best of my knowledge this is not a real coffee shop, and any similarities are purely coincidental.</p>

      <p class="col-1-2">After implementing these designs into a responsive page I found that the changes from mobile to desktop were too jarring, and the final desktop design was too cluttered.  I also felt the mobile design was too plain, so I incorporated a few of the desktop ideas into it.  After simplifying the desktop design to be more like the mobile I found the flow from one screen size to the other was much better.</p>
