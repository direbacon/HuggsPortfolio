    <h1>Ignitor Labs Redesign Proposal</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="work-content">
    <div class="col-full">
      <p>This was a proposed redesign for the Ignitor Labs website that I worked on in conjunction with Dori Rivera.  The redesign was dropped due to production schedule constraints and the designs were never approved or denied.</p>
      <p>The image on the <span class='rep-lefttop'></span> is for the homepage of the website, and the <span class='rep-rightbottom'></span> is for the about page.  My contributions were designing the header and menu bar as well as the accent elements for the content sections.  On the home page I fully designed the tagline section beneath the menu bar, and the news section.  On the about page I adjusted the typography and minor design elements to be consistent with the home page.  Finally I organized the Photoshop files to be ready for use in Edge Reflow or Dreamweaver.</p>
