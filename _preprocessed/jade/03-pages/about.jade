                    p Hi, I’m Brett and I like solving problems.  The problem that anyone has is communicating to everyone, and I see design as the solution for that.  I might be new to front-end development, but I’ve been using design to help communicate for several years.  I started with character animation in school, worked designing layouts for business cards and flyers, moved on to animating Instructional courses, and followed up with designing interfaces for apps and LMS systems.  For me, front-end is the next step in that progression.  Creating a well structured design that will easily flex and maintain its flow is an exhilarating challenge to me, and I love it.

                        p Brett has an amazing array of skills. In addition to being an extremely talented artist, he compliments his creative side with extensive knowledge in the technical arena as well. However, the thing that has impressed me most is how he takes that talent and channels it through an ability to lead a team to success and always encourage them to reach for more. It was a true privilege to work with him.

                        p As a mentor and a manager, Brett is top-notch. The way he was able to explain things to his team was easy to understand and straight-forward without being dumbed-down. His asset-building skills - be it in Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, etc. - are equally as impressive. He's also quite skilled at multi-tasking, being able to bounce between administrative tasks, animation, audio editing, and numerous other jobs. Brett is definitely a great leader and a wonderful co-worker.

                        p Brett is incredibly detail-oriented. He is concise and dedicated to every project I have seen him undertake - and he's completed a wide variety of tasks. With each new obstacle he has managed to go beyond the requirements while learning as much as he can so that in the future, he will be well prepared to undertake that task again. He is also very willing to share his knowledge with others and push them to become better.
